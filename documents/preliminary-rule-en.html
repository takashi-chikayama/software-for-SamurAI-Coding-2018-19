	This document describes the system of the qualifying round and the
	advancement criteria for SamurAI Coding 2018&ndash;19 contest.
      </p>
    </div>


    <h2>Qualifying Round System</h2>
    <p>
      The qualifying round is conducted as a round-robin tournament,
      in which all the participating teams play one game (two races
      exchanging the start positions) against all the other teams, as
      long as the number of participating teams allows it.  If the
      number of teams is too many for a single round-robin tournament,
      the qualification round will be organized with two rounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a two-round qualifier, participating teams are divided into
      several groups for the first round.  A round-robin tournament is
      conducted in each of the groups.  Around 30 teams with higher
      ranks in the first-round groups are advanced to the final
      qualifier, which is conducted as a round-robin tournament again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to the limited time and resource, the numbers of teams in
      each of the first-round qualifier are restricted to at most
      around 30.  The number of teams for the first-round groups are
      averaged as far as possible.  The same number of teams are
      advanced to the final qualifier from each group.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below is an example of the organization of the qualifying round with
      different number of participating teams.

    <h2>Round-Robin Tournaments</h2>

    <p>
      A round-robin tournament with <var>n</var> teams consists
      of <var>n</var>&minus;1 stages, each with different opponents.
      When the number of teams in the tournament is odd, a player
      provided by the organizer is added to make it even, making each
      of the team play against all the other teams.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the games in each stage use the same race course, and different
      courses are used in different stages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ranks of a round-robin tournaments are decided according to the
      following criteria, in this order.
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Total points.  In each stage, game winners are given two points and
	  losers are given no points.  When the game is drawn, both will be
	  given one point.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Total time.  The total of the goal time of all the races of all the
	  stages.  The goal time is defined in the game rules.
	</li>
      </ul>
      When two or more teams are still ranked the same with the above
      criteria, ranks are decided by drawing lots.
    </p>

    <h2>Race Courses</h2>
    <p>
      Race courses used in the qualifying round will be generated by
      <a href=https://github.com/takashi-chikayama/software-for-SamurAI-Coding-2018-19/tree/master/course_generator>
	a randomized course generator in development</a>
      The course generator program and data files used will be fixed
      and uploaded to the web page of the contest
      before the entry deadline of the preliminary round,
      and modifications after that will be only for fixing bugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The courses generated will satisfy the following.
      <ul>
	<li>
	  The course length is between 50 and 100, inclusive.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The course width is between 5 and 20, inclusive.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The vision limit is greater than or equal to 5.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The initial remaining time is 200ms times the step limit plus 1000ms.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Advancement to the World Finals</h2>
    <p>
      Sixteen teams in total will be advanced to the world finals.
      Eight or more higher-ranked teams in the qualification round (in
